# M3Commerce/Framework

## What?

M3 aims to provide a minimal, solid, scalable and easily customizable framework for building bespoke shopping experiences.
Our main focus areas are:

 - _event driven CQRS architecture_
 - _reduced setup footprint_
 - _highly & easily extensible_
 - _GraphQL API out of the box_
 - _developer friendly_

## Why?

I am a ferm beliver in DDD. Domain driven design, and domain driven development if you wish. I think the code should serve the business case, and not the other way around. Or in other words, the "way it's built", should not hinder developing new features or changing behaviour.
I grew mildly, then very frustrated when lookind at current open source solutions for developing and deploying web stores or apis to serve mobile apps for bespoke business use cases. Often as a developer, I get to ask myself: "why was it done this way?!"
Usually the answer lays behind monolithic code bases, hard dependencies on a cms system, layers of caching or 
legacy compatibility.

**As developers we can overcome this, but we don't have to.**

## When?

The current plan is to launch in Fall 2023. However this is likely to change. So fingers crossed.
